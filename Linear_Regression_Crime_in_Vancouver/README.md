For my final project, I used linear regression, Python, Excel and Tableau to analyze crime in Vancouver.  I used this project mostly to practice my data analysis skills.  Crime is a difficult subject to tackle for such a small project.  As such, the results in this project should not be seen as an actual solution to crime in Vancouver.
