The following dataset explores 1000 students’ scores in math, reading and writing, and gives information on their gender, ethnicity (given as group A-E),  parental education level,  type of lunch given (a standard or free/reduced lunch) and the type of test preparation completed.

In this project I will be exploring the data using Tableau, then answering 3 questions using regression analysis in Tableau:
What factors contribute to receiving a high mark?
What is the effect of test preparation on students' marks?
What is the effect of gender on students’ marks?
